# Choose Together App

This project aims at helping parentes to choose a name for their child.
It is NOT a Baby Name Generator.
It is a DECISION MAKING TOOL :)

## Story

Imagine you and your partner have to find a name for your child, BUT... you have different preferences.
You prefer name "Linda", and he/she preferes name "Marry". Still, you may consider some other names, like "Jess", "Emily", "Anna". 
Your partner also has a list of 15 other names that she likes.
So - there are many names, different opinions, and a child that needs to have a name.

This app helps you to go through this decision making process in a pleasent and peaceful way.
You just need to follow these steps:

### `1. Create Pool of Names`

Together with your partner write down names, that you are taking in the consideration.
For example, when I used this method together with my wife we've created a list of 30 names, where I had 12 name "candidates" and she had 18.

### `2. Copmare Names In Pairs`



See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
